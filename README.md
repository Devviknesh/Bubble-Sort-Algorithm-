### ðŸš€ Bubble Sort Algorithm in C  
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the array is sorted. The algorithm has a time complexity of **O(nÂ²)** in the worst and average cases, making it inefficient for large datasets.  

#### ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Steps:  
1. Start from the first element and compare it with the next.  
2. Swap if the current element is greater than the next one.  
3. Move to the next pair and repeat step 2 for the entire array.  
4. The largest element "bubbles" to the end after each pass.  
5. Repeat the process for the remaining elements until the array is sorted.  

#### ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:  
- **Best Case (Already Sorted):** O(n)  
- **Worst & Average Case:** O(nÂ²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (In-place Sorting)  

Bubble Sort is mostly used for educational purposes due to its inefficiency compared to other sorting algorithms like **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort**.
